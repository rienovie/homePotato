# homePotato
An alexia-like system for the le Potato board.

As of right now, this is a work in progress.
My goal is to replace my Alexia Show with this project.
I want as little external dependencies as possible and it to be as simple as possible, but I know that's a bit much for now.

I currently have a le Potato board, a 5-inch touchscreen, standard USB speakers, and a conference microphone.
